This is still very much a work in progress. The Raptor engine works, and it will be improved over the next several days.

## Raptor
The RAPTOR pathbuilder is based on [Round-Based Public Transit Routing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/raptor_alenex.pdf) algorithm developed by Daniel Delling, Thomas Pajor, and Renato F. Werneck at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley.

The RAPTOR algorithm also builds off of a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/kuanb/a45b65c3135dce717497643e7f35f0ab) and a series of [blog posts from Kuan Butts](http://kuanbutts.com/2020/09/14/raptor-with-cache/). The algorithm contained in this repository relies on more vectorization to improve performance, but Kuan's prototypes were instrumental in understanding the algorithm publised in the research paper.
